Operating System Functions:
1. Starting Computers and Mobile Devices is the first fuction that we will notice at the first time we start using a computer or mobile. Every device provides power buttom. It is originally used to turn on/off a device. Also, It could be used to restart or reboot a computer or mobile device. 
2. Shutting Down Computers and Mobile Devices shares the same buttom with starting function. Some people like to shut their computers down when they finish working. Some people don't do so; they will always keep their computers on. This function includes sleep mode and shutting down. Shutting a computer down will keep the computer safe and save its battery.
